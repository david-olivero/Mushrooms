## Name That Mushroom!
The world of mycology is a veritable universe unto itself, in the soil around all of us. Forest floors invite exploration and discovery for young and old, novices and experts. And the world of mushrooms is diverse enough that even a seasoned mushroom hunter will find mushrooms she can’t always identify. Mushrooms are at once alluring and anxiety-causing; the right mushroom can be delicious, but the wrong mushroom can be a toxic experience. Imagine if a computer could help you identify which mushroom you’re looking at? In this project, we will train a machine learning model on images of different common mushroom genus, to see if it can be like having a mushroom expert in your pocket!
